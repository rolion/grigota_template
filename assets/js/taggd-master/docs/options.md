# Options

The `options` parameter is an object of options.

Available options are:

```js
{
  // The event to show the tag
  show: 'mouseenter',
  // The event to hide the tag
  hide: 'mouseleave',

  // The duration before the tag popup is actually hidden.
  // If there is spacing between the tag button and popup, and you use mouseover/mouseout to toggle visiblity, you probably want to keep this.
  hideDelay: 500,
}
```
